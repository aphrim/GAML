#Greg's Awesomely Magical Language (GAML)

My friend made PAML (https://github.com/techieji/PAML) so I had to make GAML.

##What is GAML?

GAML is a my first attempt at a coding language, and therefore, is kind of terrible.
However, due to it being terrible, I think it is ok to instead just call it an esoteric language.

##Spec

The syntax sucks, don't try to learn it.
Preserve your mental sanity, do not try to code in this.
It is slow and hard.
I have included 3 example programs, I have no wish to explain the syntax, as even I can't.
